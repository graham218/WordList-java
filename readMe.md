WordLists is a very simple class that performs six methods: the first returns an array with words of a given length, the second returns an array of words beginning with a desired letter, the third returns an array with words of a certain length containing, but not starting with, a given letter, the fifth returns words of length specified that have at least a certain number of vowels and the last method returns words with a given number of letter-repeats.
The tester class creates a new instance of WordLists, passing in the file to the constructor, and executing each method. The class has some error handling methods, depending on their ocurrance in the implementation of methods.
